      <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a UI/UX designer and front-end developer based in sunny St. Petersburg, Florida with an affinity for cups of tea, Disney, and kind people.</p>
      <p><strong>My specialties include drafting wireframes, creating interactive prototypes, web accessibility, and translating designs into code.</strong></p>
      <p>I grew up in small-town Indiana with professional endeavors landing me in Indianapolis, New York City, and presently Tampa Bay, Florida. My experience ranges from agency work specializing in marketing and web development to product work with a focus in interfaces for mobile and web applications.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I’m a regular at Walt Disney World and local craft breweries, and I curate Disney-inspired content on <a href="https://instagram.com/taylorintheteacups" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. I also sell handmade items on <a href="https://etsy.com/shop/taydunworth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etsy</a>.</p>
