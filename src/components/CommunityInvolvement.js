          <p>Women Who Code provides a community for women in technology with in-person and virtual events focused on professional growth in the technology industry, technical skills, and networking.

          <h3>Conference Organizer, Tampa Bay Startup Week (2019)</h3>
          <p>Tampa Bay Startup Week is a volunteer-led celebration of innovation and entrepreneurship in Tampa Bay. Within the free five-day event, attendees have access to speakers on topics such as public relations, marketing, tech, and social media.</p>
          <p>As the web development track captain, I selected speakers for individual sessions and panels related to web and software development. After securing speakers, I acted as their point of contact for session information and scheduling. In addition to speaker responsibilities, I managed social media promotions for the track. Sessions for 2019 included "Inclusive Design and Development with Web Accessibility," "Women Transforming Tech," "So You Want to be a Freelance Web Developer?," and "Component Libraries."</p>
